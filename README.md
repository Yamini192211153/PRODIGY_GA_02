# 🖼️ Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

## 📌 Task 2 - Prodigy InfoTech (Generative AI Intern)

As part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I completed **Task 2**, which focused on **image generation from text prompts** using **pre-trained generative models** like **Stable Diffusion**. This project enabled me to explore text-to-image synthesis, build intuitive interfaces, and understand the power of prompt engineering for visual creativity.

## 🛠️ Implementation Overview

✅ **Model Used**  
- Utilized `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` from Hugging Face's **Diffusers** library for reliable and GPU-optimized performance.

✅ **Setup and Environment**  
- Configured environment in Google Colab using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers + Diffusers.
- Verified GPU availability and enabled efficient memory use with CPU offloading and attention slicing.

✅ **Image Generation Functions**  
- Created modular functions to:
  - Generate images from custom prompts
  - Apply advanced settings (e.g., guidance scale, steps, seed)
  - Save and display generated outputs

✅ **Interactive Generator**  
- Built a user-friendly **interactive interface** to input prompts, modify advanced parameters, and generate multiple styles of images on the fly.

✅ **Batch and Style Transfer Tools**  
- Included advanced utilities for:
  - Batch image generation from prompt lists
  - Style variation of a subject (e.g., anime, oil painting, cyberpunk)

✅ **Testing and Examples**  
- Successfully generated multiple images from prompts like:
  - "A cute cat sitting on a wooden table"
  - "A robot making coffee in a modern kitchen"
  - "A magical forest with glowing mushrooms"
